# Changelog

[简体中文](CHANGELOG.md) | [English](CHANGELOG_EN.md)

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Fix Chinese-locale Windows export hang / GBK decode errors in `export_pptx.py` / `export_images.py` (capture stdout via temp file + UTF-8)
- Work around agent-browser `--download-path` silently canceling Chrome downloads: click download and poll the default Downloads folder
- Stop shipping `__pycache__/*.pyc` in the npm package (list script sources explicitly in `files`)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Align PPTD with official element-level `animations`; Skill notes for animation / `notes` usage bounds
- Align image priority, anti-AI copy rules, clarification asks, replicate guidance, and parallel page writes
- Ship ~30 preset design systems, invoked only when named
- Restore `customFonts` (Google Fonts) and poster size recommendations
- Root theme catalogs: `theme.md` / `theme_EN.md` (with preview images)
- Sample project `example/xiaomi-yu7-ppt-animation` (on-slide entrance animations)

### Changed

- Sync scenario docs with official animation guidance and `customFonts` references
- README: document element animations, preset themes, and sample prompts

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- `install` overwrites an existing skill by default; `--force` is no longer required (still accepted for compatibility)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Skill workflow **step0 prerequisite check**: verify Node.js 18+, npm/npx, and python3 before generation; note that a Chromium-based browser is required for export
- Export scripts check **Node.js 18+** and **npm** at startup, with clear install guidance when missing or too old
- CLI (`open-kimi-ppt-skills`) refuses to start when the Node.js major version is below 18
- Auto-install **PyYAML** via `pip install --user pyyaml` when missing (same pattern as Pillow / websocket-client)

### Docs

- Added multi-agent / multi-model example screenshots (ChatGPT·Codex + 5.6 Luna, Reasonix + DeepSeek, WorkBuddy, and more)
- Clarified install as “automatic or manual — pick one”, with Windows path notes
- Updated README structure and example images

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Initial release of `open-kimi-ppt-skills`
- PPTD create / edit / replicate, delivering both an editable PPTD project and a PPTX by default
- Browser-side PPTX export (embedded fonts, fade transitions) with optional multimodal visual QA before export
- Local in-browser PPTD editor (`npx open-kimi-ppt-skills serve`)
- CLI to install the skill into `~/.agents/skills` (or another agent directory via `--target`)
